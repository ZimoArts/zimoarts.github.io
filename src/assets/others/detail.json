Mental health has become an even greater issue the world over. To chip away at these issues and to pursue my dreams of making everyone happier, I created this poster in Chinese and erected it in 798 Art Zone, an art and cultural landmark in Beijing. This is an interactive poster. Before you open it it simply says “living in this world, it’s all about laughing at yourself and smiling to others; If you are not having a happy day, please open this.” When the viewer finally opens it, they see a joke. When I put it up, I was shocked that almost everyone who walked by took a few minutes to read it. The smile that they put up on their faces seem to indicate their pleasure. ",

I included Chinese elements, such as three dragon figures that are colored in blue, purple, and yellow. One old Chinese folktale tells of a fish swimming against the current and up a waterfall, transforming into a dragon when it reaches the top of the mountain. This story motivates me to always believe in myself and try to overcome difficulties to achieve my dreams.",
