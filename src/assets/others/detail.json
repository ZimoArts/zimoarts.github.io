            "description": "After 3 years of Covid, the happiness level became lower than ever in China. Depression became a big issue all over the world. In order to solve this problem and to go after my dream of making everyone happier. I created this poster in Chinese and I put it up in 798 (the biggest art gathering place in Beijing). This is an interactive poster. Before you open it it simple says “living in this world, it’s all about laughing at yourself and smiling to others; If you are not having a happy day, please open this.” When the viewer finally opens it, there is a joke inside it; When I put it up, I was shocked that almost everyone who walked by took a few minutes to read it. The smile that they put up on their face seems to indicate their pleasure and my success. ",

I included Chinese elements such as the three dragon figures that are colored in blue, purple, and yellow. There was an old story in China where a fish went against the current and it swam to the top of a waterfall. When it finally overcame all the difficulties and get to the top of the mountain it became a dragon. This story motivates me to always believe in myself and try to overcome the difficulties to achieve my dream.",
