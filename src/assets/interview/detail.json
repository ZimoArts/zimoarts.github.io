            "description": "This is a piece of performance art that I self-directed and acted in. This piece was made initially as an installation piece telling the story of myself. I later realized that if it’s about myself, I, myself should be a part of it. These projections revealed my story. It’s the story of once not being accepted; it is the story of working hard; it is the story of nostalgia; it is the story about hiding the true-self; it is the story about perseverance; it is also the story about optimism and determination; dream and difficulties. Welcome to my life, my past, my present, and my future. Understand the past, cherish your present, and dream of your future.",
