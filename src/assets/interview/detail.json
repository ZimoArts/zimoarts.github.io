            "description": "Everyone seems to be hiding an aspect of themselves because they are afraid that their true self won’t be accepted by the general public. This play which I self directed and acted in tells a story of a man who tries so hard to hide his true self, but less does he know his secret will be revealed when one of his colleagues comes to visit him. I, when writing this play, try to tell the audience: Don’t be afraid to be yourself in front of others. After all, people around us might be more accepting and friendly than you would imagine. ",

            "description": "This is a piece of performance art that I self-directed and acted in. This piece was made initially as an installation piece telling the story of myself. I later realized that if it’s about myself, I, myself should be a part of it. These projections revealed my story. It’s the story of once not being accepted; it is the story of working hard; it is the story of nostalgia; it is the story about hiding the true-self; it is the story about perseverance; it is also the story about optimism and determination; dream and difficulties. Welcome to my life, my past, my present, and my future. Understand the past, cherish your present, and dream of your future.",
