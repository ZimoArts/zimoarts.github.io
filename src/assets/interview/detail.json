            "description": "<span style='font-size: 2.25rem;line-height: 2.5rem;font-weight: 300;'>I</span> met Yangzi, a great abstract artist, a photographer, and an art curator when I was walking around the 798 Art District. When I first met him, his optimistic attitude and his sophisticated manner prompted me to learn more about his story. He talked about himself, a poor disabled student at the age of 18 who came to Beijing with 200 dollars in his pocket and an empty backpack. He had no friends in this city and had no idea what it is like here in Beijing. The only things he has are his passion for art and his dream of being a pioneer artist. During this interview, he said, “Living comes before Dream. You have to be alive in order to paint.(translated).” I was deeply fascinated by his story, so I decided to interview him and tell his story to more people. Dreams are fiction. Everyone has their own dream, but not everyone has the courage to go after it. Yangzi didn’t give up his dream even though he had nothing but water for 7 days and almost died. Hopefully, his story can inspire more and more people and give them the motivation to pursue through the storms because rainbows always come after storms.",
