            "description": "This is a piece of performance art that I self-directed and acted in, made originally as an installation piece telling my life story. These projections tell a tale of once not having been accepted; of working hard; of nostalgia; of hiding the true-self. They also tell of perseverance; of optimism and determination; of dreams and difficulties. Welcome to my life: my past, my present, and my future. Understand the past, cherish your present, and dream of your future.",
