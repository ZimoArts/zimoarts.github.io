Students are forced to be placed into these boxes so that schools can evaluate their success with various standards. For example, to put yourself into the “Ivy” box, you need a good SAT score, a high GPA, good activities, and maybe a wealthy or successful parent. Even if you have all that, you need some luck. However, most of the time, what’s written on the resume or application of an applicant isn’t who one really is. There are additional unwritten qualities in each person that makes them a separate and special individual. To me, education means more than just putting oneself into boxes. I’ve seen my friends choosing to take the hardest AP classes not because they actually are interested in the material but rather because the classes will get them into the “good colleges.” I think education should not be disregarded as a simple process of making and fitting into boxes. I wanted to encourage students with this artwork, telling them that creativity should not have a limit or a standard to it. Unbox yourself! Be who you truly are! Take the classes you want to take: That will make you who you want to be in the future. ",

When I saw the prompt for the competition, I immediately thought of a famous line from the famous politician GuanZhong stressing the importance of education in China: “十年树木，百年树人。” This translates to “It takes ten years to nurture a tree, but it takes 100 years to educate a man.” Nurturing a man is ten times harder, but it is fundamentally important for the prosperity of society. Interestingly enough, the Chinese character 树 here not only refers to the tree but also acts as a verb, an action that can be interpreted as educating, establishing, or setting up. GuanZhong's message inspired this piece. In it, I used actual tree branches, cloth, Barbie dolls, paper, rope, and paint. As I wrapped the doll with cloth and wove it onto the tree, I drew a connection between the growth of a tree and the growth of a man. I hung little paper tags on the trees to illustrate what education is for me: Hope, Growth, Life, Wealth, and Status. I hope this artwork can prompt viewers to think about what education means for them. ",

Christo, one of the greatest artists of the 21st century, died the year before, but his collaborators completed this as one his last wishes. Christo never explained why he did it, caring more about the spectacle of public art. The art, of course, conveys meaning: perhaps about covering up France’s military history or maybe the exact opposite by celebrating the “gift” of France’s identity. But the key for Christo was that the viewer themselves decided, as art for Cristo was meant to be viewed, judged, and appreciated by the public.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christo has inspired my own art. I was born and raised in Beijing. The Great Wall is one of our proudest accomplishments, one of the greatest infrastructure projects ever, spanning over 13,000 miles. It was therefore a shock to realize in my research that the Great Wall might not have been so great, having been built over centuries through the lives, labor, and deaths of hundreds of thousands of prisoners and peasants. This is why historians call it the “longest cemetery on earth.” Even worse, I realized we in China had walls all around us. There was no freedom of expression or freedom of the press. We have long been trapped by invisible walls. So when I came to the US, I at first felt free. But slowly, over time, I realized maybe there were different walls around race, ethnicity and identity. I felt it in subtle ways, such as the assumptions people made about me because of how I looked or the way I talked. I realized we all have walls, but maybe they exist in our minds more than in the real world. That is why I made a large public art exhibition at my school. It took me three months. The sculpture is made of heavy fabric, one side white and the other black, hung on metal rods ten feet high, that are secured into the ground. I stenciled a word on each side: Difference; Identity; Perspective; Equality. I cut the fabric into long strips so one could pass through it. The key was that I set it up while my entire school was in a meeting. They went into the building as usual, but when they came out, the walkways were “blocked” by my exhibition. At first, students walked around the exhibition. But soon people started to walk through and realized the sides displayed different colors and words.</span>",
