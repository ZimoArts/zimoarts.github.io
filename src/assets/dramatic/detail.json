            "description": "Everyone seems to be hiding an aspect of themselves because they are afraid that their true self won’t be accepted by the general public. This self-directed and acted play tells a story of a man who tries so hard to hide his true self, but little does he know, his secrets will be revealed when one of his colleagues comes to visit him. In writing this piece I try to send my audience the following message: Don’t be afraid to be yourself. After all, people around us might be more accepting and friendly than you would imagine. ",

            "description": "This is a piece of performance art that I self-directed and acted in, made originally as an installation piece telling my life story. These projections tell a tale of once not having been accepted; of working hard; of nostalgia; of hiding the true-self. They also tell of perseverance; of optimism and determination; of dreams and difficulties. Welcome to my life: my past, my present, and my future. Understand the past, cherish your present, and dream of your future.",
